# Crowdfunding

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Setup firebase database

* Create a database with firebase
* Create a api-keys.ts file in app directory
* In api-keys.ts place with your information:

    export var masterFirebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "xxxx",
      authDomain: "xxxx.firebaseapp.com",
      databaseURL: "https://xxxx.firebaseio.com",
      storageBucket: "xxxx.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "xxxx"
    };


## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Further help

## Planning

* Create router file
* Create welcome component and routes that will eventually display list of projects
* Create project model
* Create project service
* Create database with firebase
* List projects on welcome page
* Create dynamic routes component to display information about an individual project
* Create admin component for adding, updating and deleting projects
